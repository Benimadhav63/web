    <h1>The BEM convention is used for efficiently naming the classes. BEM stands for Block-Element-Modifier. Blocks are independent, reusable and usually bigger components of a webpage. Elements are children of blocks. An element can only have 1 parent Block, and can't be used independently outside of that block. Modifiers represent different states or styles of classes. They can be used both for blocks or elements.</h1>

        <p style="color:red">Here the Block is div, Element is para and Modifier is red. So the BEM name is going to be div__para--red</p>
