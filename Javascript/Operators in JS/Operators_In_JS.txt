Q1) Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even or odd using the ternary operator
Ans1) Ternary Operator: The “Question mark” or “conditional” operator in JavaScript is a ternary operator that has three operands. It is the simplified operator of if/else.

Program:-
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();
let num = prompt("Enter a number:");
let result = (num%2==0) ? " is even" : " is odd";
console.log(num + result);


Q2) Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example. 
Ans2) JavaScript Comma Operator:- Comma Operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand. A comma operator is used as a separator for multiple expressions at a place that requires a single expression. When a comma operator is placed in an expression, it executes each expression and returns the rightmost expression.
Syntax:
Expression1, Expression2, Expression3, ...so on
In the above syntax, multiple expressions are separated using a comma operator. During execution, each expression will be executed from left to right and the rightmost expression will be returned.

Example 1: Below is an example of the Comma operator.

function Func1() { 
    console.log('one'); 
    return 'one'; 
} 
function Func2() { 
    console.log('two'); 
    return 'two'; 
} 
function Func3() { 
    console.log('three'); 
    return 'three'; 
}   
// Three expressions are 
// given at one place 
let x = (Func1(), Func2(), Func3());   
console.log(x);

Q3) Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print 
“positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

Ans3) Program:- 
let num = prompt("Enter a number:");
let result= (num==0) ? " is zero" : num>0 ? " is positive" : " is negative";
console.log(num + result);


Q4) Use a ternary operator to check that a person is eligible to vote or not by checking his age. If the age of the 
person is less than 18 then “You cannot vote” should be logged else “You can vote” should be logged.
Ans4) Program:- 
let age = prompt("Enter your age:");
let result1= (age>=18) ? "You can vote" : "You cannot vote";
console.log(result1);
